# Cows-and-Bulls-Game-using-Python

The game works like this:
Randomly generate a 4-digit number. Ask the user to guess a 4-digit number.
For every digit the user guessed correctly in the correct place, they have a
"cow". For every digit the user guessed correctly in the wrong place, they
have a "bull".Everytime the user makes a guess, tell them how many "cows" 
and "bulls" they have. Once the user guessses the correct number, the game is over.
keep te=rack of number of guesses the user makes throughout the game and tell
the user at the end.
